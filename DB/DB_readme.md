# database logic 
**Logic:** Ensure your database is correctly set up with the necessary tables and relationships. This is the foundation for data storage and retrieval.

Tasks:
 - Write SQL scripts to create the tasks and users tables.

 - Define relationships and constraints (e.g., foreign keys).

 - Populate the database with initial data for testing.
